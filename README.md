# Showcase for Giftogames Workflow

I built this workflow and bug template from scratch for Giftogamesâ€™ QA pipeline. I've mainly used Jira and Google Sheet to set it up.

# Workflow 

Here is the Workflow for Giftogames, I've set up a workflow for bugs, feedback and tasks that the developers use on their day to day tasks.

You can use filters to only show bugs, tasks or feedbacks :

A detailed template for entering bugs, useful for new testers that might join the project later as we scaled it up :
