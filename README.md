# Showcase for Giftogames Workflow

I built this workflow and bug template from scratch for Giftogames’ QA pipeline. I've mainly used Jira and Google Sheet to set it up.

# Workflow 

Here is the Workflow for Giftogames, I've set up a workflow for bugs, feedback and tasks that the developers use on their day to day tasks.

This is the Board, where all the relevant bugs, tasks and feedbacks are displayed :

You can use filters to only show bugs, tasks or feedbacks :

# Bug Template 

A detailed template for entering bugs, useful for new testers that might join the project later as we scaled it up :

# Smoketest Template

The Smoketest template I have build for testing the build before pushing a major update. Every single action you can do in the game is listed with a status, then if failed a bug is added on excel that redirects to the Jira for clear visibility. Here is some part of the smoke test (It would be too long to list everything) :
